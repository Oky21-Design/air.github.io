Firstly, the AIR Project was the idea of us two ATR Aircraft
Engineers, Yordi and Dimas. We both saw that there was
ineffectivity and inefficiency on current Aircraft Readiness
Report. We want to make a reliable, faster and better
reporting system. But we are not capable enough to make a
website with data driven-dashboard. Then we got help
from our data science enthusiast Rofiq, and two bright
Binus University IT undergraduate students, Oky and Andy.
